# CANoe-Minimum-Safety-Distance-Simulation
CANoe Configuration simulating the min-safety distance formula in car2x.

This CANoe configuration implements the minumum safety distance formula used by autonomous vehicles to simulate a vehicle that maintains an appropriate distance from cars in front, thus keeping enough time to perform an emergency stop. The CANoe window displays the current distance away from the vehicle in front, as well as the minimum distance required to safely break if needed.

The project was done during the ADAS module in 4th year of the Applied Computing course.
